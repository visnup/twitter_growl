h2. Twitter Growl

I just want to receive Growl notifications when my friends update their Twitter statuses and I don't want to install the memory hog that is Twitterific.

h2. Installation

# Install "growlnotify":http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify from the Growl
  disk image
# Create a config.yml file based on config.yml.sample and update it with your
  Twitter username and password
# Add a cron job:

<blockquote><pre><code>
  # twitter-growl
  */5 * * * * twitter-growl/twitter_growl.rb
</code></pre></blockquote>
